## Overview and Origin

 TransUnion (NYSE: TRU) is a global information company better known for its consumer credit reporting practice. TransUnion collects data from consumer, aggregates and produces insights for each consumer that is ultimately sold to, financial institutions and other companies. These institutions rely on TransUnion's insights to offer the best products available to each consumer in the most cost-efficient way.  

 The company was founded in 1968 by the Union Tank Car Company, a railcar leasing operation, and in 1969 it recognized the opportunity in the credit reporting space and acquired the Credit Bureau of Cook County. Since then, the company grew both organically and inorganically to become one of the largest credit bureaus in the world. In addition to several transformational acquisitions through the years, in 2015 it did its initial public offering (IPO) in the NYSE. Prior to its IPO, TransUnion was owned by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Advent International.

 The IPO was for c. $663mm valuing the company at ~$4 billion. For reference, at the time of the IPO, the prior year's revenues were $1.3 billion. The current market capitalization of the company is $15.4 billion. Being publicly traded and an established company, TransUnion benefits from access to the capital markets to raise debt and equity in addition to cash flow from operations to pursue inorganic growth and to optimize the capital structure with the right combination of debt and equity. As of June 30, 2020, the company had $3.6 billion in financial debt. 

 At acquisition, in 1969, the purchase of a credit bureau followed more likely the conglomerate trend started in the late 1950s. Due to the incorporation of certain regulatory constraints, cash flow positive and well established corporations looking to grow inorganically had to do so outside of their industry of expertise. The push into technology and analytics goes back to the 1990s when they "strengthened our analytics and decisioning capabilities by acquiring one of the most powerful technologies for high-volume, individual-level decisions" (Company website). Since then the company has grown its product swift offered to companies leveraging all the data collected over the years and analytical tools available to collect and process such data.  

 TransUnion is headquartered in Chicago, IL and has over 7,500 across 30+ countries. Other interesting metrics are the company's reach to 1 billion consumers, 65,000 businesses and more than 30 'petabytes' of data. 

## Business Activities:

 TransUnion offers a wide array of products, 101 to be precise, categorized under customer credit reporting, fraud detection, customer analytics and consulting, debt recovery, digital lending, identity verification and authentication, healthcare revenue recovery among many others. 

 The company's intended customers are financial institutions, which may include traditional banks, monoline lenders (consumer finance, auto finance, mortgage lending, etc.), alternative lenders, as well as companies in the following industries: insurance, healthcare, communications, property management, among others. Broadly speaking, any company who offers a product or service and does not collect the sale price immediately.

 The main financial problem the company is trying to solve is the lack of information or even worse, asymmetric information. While this is a reality in every aspect of life, it has a huge impact when the profitability of the product offered by a company depends on the consumers' behaviors and in particular their willingness and capacity to pay back in the future. Some examples of companies benefiting from the product are consumer finance companies and banks that generally use consumers information to determine whether they will issue a loan and if they do so, at what price on for how long. 

 The market size in 2020 is estimated at $11.7 billion, 11.4% less than in 2019 due to COVID; however, showing an annual compounded growth of 3% for the prior 5 years (IBIS). It is worth noting that this only reflects the US and not international markets. The US tends to be more advanced in credit reports usage than other countries, that are catching up on the trend. As a reference, ~30% of TransUnionâ€™s revenues came from outside the US

 
 Credit bureaus use technologies on many fronts of their operations: to collect information, to process information, to make better estimates of credit scores, and lastly in the distribution of such information. While Credit bureaus have been conducting business since 1950 and therefore have been using in one way or another the techniques behind artificial intelligence, big data analysis and machine learning, the advent of the new technologies enabled credit bureaus to conduct their analysis faster and more efficiently, adjust their models periodically and seamlessly as well as slowly incorporating alternative data to enhance their credit models. In some instances, the new technologies are shifting companies from the use of traditional linear regression models to non-linear models. Additionally, with the use of alternative data, customers who are currently unbanked or have no credit history, would have more access to products offered by financial institutions at more accessible prices. 

## Landscape:


 This company, together with other credit bureaus and credit agencies is in the financial services domain, and as the classification indicates it, offer services to other financial institutions, which will use that information to offer mainly lending products.  

 The major trends in the industry have been: 
 * **Automation:** it allowed companies to collect data more efficiently from banks and other institutions who report consumers information back to the agencies
 * **Big Data Techniques:** not only it enables credit companies to process traditional data more efficiently and faster but it also enabled the use of alternative data such as telephone and mobile phone providers, rent information, utilities among others. 
 * **Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning:** it enabled credit bureaus to enhance their traditional models, which tend to show a point in time, to identify trends that can be used to make more accurate predictions as well as the implementation of other predictive models that could potentially have more predictive power than the traditional linear regression models. 
 * **Technology:** in the traditional sense of the word, more computational power, has been a key enabler. 
 

 TransUnion's direct competitors are FICO and Experian; however, since 2008, many alternative lenders (e.g. LendingClub, Affirm, Prosper, OnDeck) had started developing and using their own credit models incorporating alternative data. It is important to highlight that most of the lenders' credit models incorporate a traditional credit score as an input, evidencing the widespread use and trust in the traditional credit bureaus.  


## Results

* TransUnion has a steady revenue stream and benefits for the widespread use of credit reporting as it is in the center of the banking industry. Historically, but more so since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, financial institutions and investors in financial institutions are laser-focused in risks. Since the GFC and only until march of 2020, the US economy has thrived and lending has been growing and hence Transunion's revenues. 

TransUnion benefits by their presence in the capital markets and strong cash flow generation to grow both organically and inorganically acquiring startups with frontier technology as well as established credit bureaus around the world. In this way, i.e. by being bigger, more global and acquiring de novo technologies, the company manages to stay current. 

The chart below shows some of the key financial metrics that TransUnion reports. These are EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), cash from operations and capital expenditures. These metrics indicate that in the past 3 years, the company not only has grown their top line while keeping their expenses in check, but also has generated cash from operations and has increased the capital expenditures to secure future growth.

* The industry as a whole has performed well given the high demand for their products. Unfortunately, market share statistics are not easily available.  


## Recommendations

 While this company and its competitors have been benefiting from the new technologies and methods to process data, I think that what the financial industry still needs is a global credit score that is transferable from country to country. While this does not impact individuals who live in the same country their whole lives, it does impact migrants around the world, from CEOs, middle management to unskilled labor and students. Once you move to a new country, no matter if you had an outstanding credit scoring in your home country, you have no credit history and hence no access to financial products in your new country. Alternative data will make this easier; however, the use of your local history will be more powerful. Given the global reach of credit bureaus, I believe that this is a matter of time before they figure out a way to deal with any potential regulatory constraints and data validation needed to transfer data globally.  

 This product will benefit the company by providing data of a large set of the population that currently does not have access to the financial industry, say to receive a loan. Similarly to the other products TransUnion sells and simplifying their business model, the more consumers covered by their data and reports the more reports sold to financial institutions.

 To date, it seems that TransUnion already has the technology needed to launch this product; however, what seems to be missing is the integration among the multiple countries and the company's ability to track a borrower to every country they go. In any case, a technology that could prove itself useful for this purpose is blockchain, which will allow to maintain the integrity of the credit data of each individual no matter where in the world that customer is.
