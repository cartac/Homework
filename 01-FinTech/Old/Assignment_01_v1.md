## Overview and Origin

* TransUnion (NYSE: TRU) is a global information company better known for its consumer credit reporting practice. TransUnion collects data from consumer, aggregates and produces insights for each consumer that is utimately sold to, financial institutions and other companies. These institutions rely on TransUnion's insights to offer the best products available to each consumer in the most cost-efficient way.  

* The company was founded in 1968 by the Union Tank Car Company, a railcar leasing operation, and in 1969 it recognized the opportunity in the credit reporting space and acquired the Credit Bureau of Cook County. Since then, the company grew both organically and inorganically to become one of the largest credit bureaus in the world. In addition to several transformational acquisitions throught the years, in 2015 it did its initial public offering (IPO) in the NYSE. Prior to its IPO, TransUnion was owned by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Advent International.

* The IPO was for c. $663mm valuing the company at ~$4 billion. For reference, at the time of the IPO, the prior year's revenues were $1.3 billion. The current market capitalization of the company is $15.4 billion. Being publicly traded and an established company, TranSunion benefits from access to the capital marktes to raise debt and equity in addition to cash flow from operationsto pursue inorganic gorwth and to optimize the capital structure with the right combination of debt and equity. As of June 30, 2020, the company had $3.6 billion in financial debt. 

* At acquisition, in 1969, the purchase of a credit bureau followed more likely the conglomerate trend started in the late 1950s. Due to the incorporation of certain regulatory constraints, cash flow positive and well established corporations looking to grow inforganically had to do so outsude of their industry of expertise. The push into technology and analytics goes back to the 1990s when they "strengthened our analytics and decisioning capabilities by acquiring one of the most powerful technologies for high-volume, individual-level decisions" (Company website). Since then the comapny has grown its product swift offered to companies leveraging all the data collected over the years and analytical tools available to collect and process such data.  

* TransUnion is headquartered in Chicago, IL and has over 7,500 across 30+ countries. Other interesting metrics are the company's reach to 1 billion consumers, 65,000 businesses and more than 30 'petabytes' of data. 

## Business Activities:

* TransUnion offers a wide array of products, 101 to be prceize, categorized under customer credit reporting, fraud detection, customer analytics and consulting, debt recovery, digital lending, identity verification and authentification, healthcare revenue recovery among many others. 

* The company's intended customers are financial institutions, which may include traditional banks, monoline lenders (consumer finance, auto finance, mortgage lending, etc.), alternative lenders, as well as companies in the following industries: insurance, healthcare, communications, property management, among others. Broadly speaking, any company who offers a product or service and does not collect the sale price immediately.

* The main financial problem the company is trying to solve is the lack of information or even worse, assymetric information. While this is a reality in every aspect of life, it has a huge impact when the profitability of the product offered by a company depends on the consumers' behaviours and in particular their willingness and capacity to pay back in the future. Some examples of companies benefiting from the produtc are consumer finance companies and banks that generally use consumers information to determine whether they will issue a loan and if they do so, at what price on for how long. 

The market size in 2020 is estimated at $11.7 billion, 11.4% less than in 2019 due to COVID; however, showing an annual compunded growth of 3% for the prior 5 years (IBIS). It is worth noting that this only reflects the US and not international markets. The US tends to be more advanced in credit reports usage than other countries, that are catching up on the trend. As a reference, ~30% of TransUninon's revenues came from outside the US

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

* Credit bureaus use technologies on many fronts of their operations: to collect information, to process information, to make better estimates of credit scores, and lastly in the distribution of such information. While Credit bureaus have been conducting business since 1950 and theerfore have been using in one way or another the techniques behind artificial inteligene, big data analysis and machine learning, the advent of the new technologies enabled credit bureuas to conduct their analysis faster and more efficiently, adjust their models periodically and seamlessly as well as slowly incorporating alternative data to enhance their credit models. In some instances, the new technologies are shifting companies from the use of traditional linear regression models to non-linear models. Additionally, with the use of alternative data, customers who are currently unbanked or have no credit history, would have more access to products offered by financial instituions at more accedssible prices. 

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
* This company, together with other credit bureaus and credit agencies is in the financial services domain, and as the classification indicates it, offer services to other financial instutions, which will use that information to offer mainly lending products.  

* The major trends in the industry have been: 
    * **Automation:** it allowed companies to collect data more efficiently from banks and other instituions who report consumers information back to the agencies
    * **Big Data Techqniues:** not only it enables credit companies to process traditional data more efficiently and faster but it also enabled the use of alternative data such as telephone and mobile phone providers, rent information, utilities among others. 
    * **Artificial Inteligence / Machine Learning:** it enabled credit bureaus to enhance their traditional models, which tend to show a point in time, to identify trends that can be used to make more accurate predictions as well as the implemetation of other predictive models that could potentially have more predictive power than the traditional linear regression models. 
    * **Technology:** in the traditional sense of the word, more computational power, has been a key enabler. 
 

* TransUnion's direct competitors are FICO and Experian; however, since 2008, many alternative lenders (e.g. LendingClub, Affirm, Prosper, OnDeck) had started developing and using their own credit models incorporating alternative data. It is important to highlight that most of the lenders' credit models incorporate a traditional credit score as an input, evidencing the widespread use and trust in the traditional credit bureaus.
